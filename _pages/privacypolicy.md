# Privacy Policy
Yaktraks and its developer take your privacy seriously. That is why no personally identifiable information is ever collected. Yaktraks does not, and never will, sell any user data. The only data that is collected is basic app usage statistics in order to help make the app better. 

When you use Yaktraks, you record clips of your voice which are stored on your device. These audio clips are never sent outside of your device, and simply cannot be shared outside of the app.

## What data is collected
The type of data that Yaktraks does collect is collected solely for improving the app. This type of data includes things like device type, iOS version, App veersion, launch count, and feature usage. This data is completely anonymous and never includes personally identifiable information. Yaktraks uses the privacy-conscious service [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) for the agregation of this data.
